# datasources-etl

This repository contains scripts developed as part of an exploration
of data required for initial mapping and the scripts required to
automate data acquisition and transformation tasks to populate a Crash
Move Folder.

A few assumptions for development:

* Scripts are developed in Python
* Data transformations rely, where possible, exclusively on Python
  libraries
